## Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/muhiddinkurbonov/TheNightOwls.git
cd TheNightOwls
```

### 2. Set Up Your Development Environment

**Quick Setup (Recommended):**

```bash
# Use the automated setup script
./scripts/dev.sh setup

# This will:
# - Check prerequisites
# - Setup database
# - Install all dependencies
# - Apply migrations
# - Build projects
```

**Manual Setup:**

If you prefer manual setup, follow the instructions in [`docs/guides/SETUP_AND_USAGE.md`](docs/guides/SETUP_AND_USAGE.md):

```bash
# Install dependencies
dotnet restore Fadebook.sln
cd Fadebook.Frontend && npm install && cd ..

# Set up environment variables
cp Fadebook.Api/.env.example Fadebook.Api/.env
# Edit Fadebook.Api/.env with your configuration

# Start the database with fresh setup
./scripts/dev.sh setup-db-fresh
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create a new branch for your work
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### Branch Naming Conventions

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `test/` - Test additions or updates
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, well-documented code
- Follow our [Coding Standards](docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md)
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Test your changes thoroughly

### 2. Test Your Changes

**Using dev.sh (Recommended):**
```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/dev.sh test
```

**Manual Testing:**

**Backend:**
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
./scripts/cicd.sh test

# Or manually
cd Fadebook.Api.Tests
dotnet test
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd Fadebook.Frontend
npm test
npm run lint
```

### 3. Update Documentation

If your changes affect:
- **API endpoints** - Update Swagger documentation comments
- **Setup process** - Update `docs/guides/SETUP_AND_USAGE.md`
- **Architecture** - Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **User features** - Update README.md

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Follow our [commit guidelines](#commit-guidelines):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(appointments): add cancellation feature"
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

## Coding Standards

We follow strict coding standards to maintain code quality and consistency. Please read our comprehensive guide:

**[ðŸ“– Full Coding Standards Documentation](docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md)**

### Quick Reference

#### C# / .NET

```csharp
// Classes, Interfaces - PascalCase
public class AppointmentController : ControllerBase { }
public interface IAuthService { }

// Private fields - _camelCase
private readonly IAuthService _authService;

// Methods, Properties - PascalCase
public async Task<User> GetUserAsync(int id) { }
public string UserName { get; set; }

// Local variables - camelCase
var userId = 1;
string userName = "john";
```

#### TypeScript / React

```typescript
// Components - PascalCase
export function Navigation() { }

// Functions, variables - camelCase
const fetchAppointments = async () => { };
const isLoading = false;

// Hooks - "use" prefix, camelCase
export function useAppointments() { }

// Types, Interfaces - PascalCase
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}
```

#### File Naming

- **C# files**: `PascalCase.cs` (AppointmentController.cs)
- **React components**: `PascalCase.tsx` (Navigation.tsx)
- **Utilities/Hooks**: `camelCase.ts` (useAuth.ts)
- **Scripts**: `kebab-case.sh` (dev.sh, cicd.sh)

3. **Testing** - Reviewer verifies functionality
4. **Approval** - PR approved by reviewer
5. **Merge** - Merged to main branch

### Merge Strategy

- **Squash and Merge** - For feature branches
- **Rebase and Merge** - For small, atomic commits
- **No Fast-Forward Merge** - To preserve history

---

## Testing Requirements

### Backend Tests

All new backend code must have corresponding tests:

- **Controllers** - Test all endpoints (happy path and error cases)
- **Services** - Test business logic with mocked dependencies
- **Repositories** - Test data access with in-memory database

**Minimum Coverage**: 50% overall, 80% for new code

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
./scripts/cicd.sh test
```

### Frontend Tests

All new frontend components should have tests:

- **Components** - Test rendering and user interactions
- **Hooks** - Test custom hook behavior
- **API calls** - Test with mocked responses

```bash
cd Fadebook.Frontend
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Good Tests

```csharp
// Good test structure (Arrange-Act-Assert)
[Fact]
public async Task CreateAppointment_ValidData_ReturnsCreated()
{
    // Arrange
    var appointmentDto = new AppointmentDto { /* ... */ };
    _mockService.Setup(s => s.AddAppointmentAsync(It.IsAny<AppointmentModel>()))
        .ReturnsAsync(appointmentModel);

    // Act
    var result = await _controller.Create(appointmentDto);

    // Assert
    result.Should().BeOfType<CreatedResult>();
}
```
